# Fake News Detection

The urgent call for applications that detect fake news is getting louder every day, with the declaration of a worldwide pandemic in 2020.
Fake news has had significant impacts not only on the spread of the virus but on the extent to which the public reads, with its restrictions, treatments, and vaccinations.
This research proposes the comparison of two types of models for the task of detecting fake news related to COVID-19. The tested algorithms were single models - Logistic Regression, K - Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees and Naive Bayes - and five Ensemble models - Random Forest, Extra Trees, Adaptive Boosting, Gradient Boosting, and Gradient Boosting extreme. This article describes all the steps, from data collection to the modelling phase. Data processing and modelling were possible using the Python 3.6.9 programming language. In addition, NumPy, NLKT, Pandas, and Sklearn libraries were used. The algorithm with the best accuracy was Random Forest (74.01%). Although accuracy is not the only possible measure to analyse the performance of a model, it was the measure chosen in this project.
